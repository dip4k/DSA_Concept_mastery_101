### 11-Section Structure (MANDATORY)
Every topic follows this framework:

| Section | Focus | Length |
|---------|-------|--------|
| 1. THE WHY | Engineering motivation | 600-1000w |
| 2. THE WHAT | Mental model & analogy | 600-1000w |
| 3. THE HOW | Mechanical walkthrough | 600-1000w |
| 4. VISUALIZATION | Examples & traces | 600-1000w |
| 5. CRITICAL ANALYSIS | Performance & costs | 400-600w |
| 6. REAL SYSTEMS | Production usage | 500-800w |
| 7. CONCEPT CROSSOVERS | How it connects | 300-400w |
| 8. MATHEMATICAL | Formal definitions | 300-500w |
| 9. ALGORITHMIC INTUITION | When to use | 500-800w |
| 10. KNOWLEDGE CHECK | Socratic questions | 200-300w |
| 11. RETENTION HOOK | Memory + 5 lenses | 900-1100w |

**Total per topic:** 4,500-6,000 words

### 5 Cognitive Lenses (MANDATORY in Section 11)
```
🖥️  Computational    → RAM model, cache, memory behavior
🧠 Psychological    → Intuition traps, misconceptions
🔄 Design Trade-off → Memory vs speed, simple vs optimized
🤖 AI/ML Analogy    → DP ↔ Bellman, search ↔ inference
📚 Historical       → Who designed it, when, evolution
```

## 🎓 Teaching Philosophy

### Start with "Why"
Every topic begins by answering "why should I care?" with real-world problems it solves.

### Mental Models First
Understand the concept through analogy and intuition before diving into mechanics.

### Real Systems Always
See how this actually appears in production systems (Linux, databases, graphics engines).

### Multiple Perspectives
Look at every concept through 5 different lenses (computational, psychological, design, AI/ML, historical).

### Engineering Thinking
Focus on decision frameworks and trade-offs, not code syntax.

### Deep Understanding
Aim for mastery, not quick memorization. Make it stick for years.

---

## 💡 Key Principles

1. **Mental Models Over Memorization** — Understand why, not just what
2. **Real Systems Over Theory** — Learn from actual production code
3. **Multiple Perspectives** — 5 cognitive lenses per topic
4. **Engineering Judgment** — When to use this vs alternatives
5. **Deep Mechanical Understanding** — Memory behavior, trade-offs, edge cases
6. **Institutional Quality** — MIT-level rigor, not shortcuts
7. **Tier-Based Mastery** — Essential patterns first (70-80%), then extensions
8. **Spaced Repetition** — Checklists support 2-day, 7-day, 30-day reviews
